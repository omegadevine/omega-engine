# Privacy Policy for Omega Engine

**Last Updated:** November 8, 2025

## Overview

Omega Engine is an open-source game engine project. This privacy policy explains our practices regarding data collection and usage.

## Data Collection

Omega Engine itself does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information. The engine runs entirely on your local machine.

### What We Don't Collect
- Personal identification information
- Usage statistics or telemetry
- Analytics data
- Network data or online activity
- Files or content created with the engine

## Open Source Nature

This project is open source and available on GitHub. When you interact with our GitHub repository:
- GitHub's own privacy policy applies to repository interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Your GitHub username and contributions are public as per GitHub's platform
- We do not separately collect or process this information

## Third-Party Components

Omega Engine may use third-party libraries and dependencies. Each has its own license and privacy considerations:
- **SDL2** - Simple DirectMedia Layer (used for window management and input)
- **Box2D** - Physics engine (runs locally, no data collection)

These libraries run locally on your machine and do not transmit data.

## Games Built With Omega Engine

Developers who create games using Omega Engine are responsible for implementing their own privacy policies if their games collect user data. Omega Engine itself provides no data collection mechanisms.

## Local Storage

The engine may create local files on your system:
- Configuration files
- Save game data (if implemented by game developers)
- Log files for debugging

All data remains on your local machine unless you explicitly choose to share it.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in this file with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## Your Rights

Since Omega Engine collects no personal data:
- There is no personal data to access, modify, or delete
- You maintain complete control over any files you create
- You can uninstall the engine at any time by deleting the files

## Consent

By using Omega Engine, you acknowledge that:
- The software runs locally on your machine
